Delusion takes your truth and your dare
While your truth is as high as your dare
Put your truth without your dare into your truth

Give back your truth


Weakness takes your strength
your power is on
your future is mysterious
While your strength is stronger than your power
If Delusion taking your strength, your power is nothing
Give back your future
Break it down

Build your power up

Give back not your future


Listen to your hearth
Scream Weakness taking your hearth
