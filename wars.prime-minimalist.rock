Darkness takes your weakness and your force
While your weakness is as high as your force
Put your weakness without your force into your weakness

Give back your weakness


Suffering takes your fear
Light Side is on
Dark Side is mysterious
While your fear is stronger than Light Side
If Darkness taking your fear, Light Side is nothing
Give back Dark Side
Break it down

Build Light Side up

Give back not Dark Side


Listen to your hearth
Scream Suffering taking your hearth
